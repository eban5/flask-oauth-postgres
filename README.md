A few of the libraries used in this project were Flask, SQL-Alchemy, psycopg2 (to talk to Postgres), and PostgresSQL. The web server was configured to use a WSGI file to make the Flask app accessible by Apache (our web server software). Apache was configured to point at that WSGI file to then server requests/responses to our web application.
